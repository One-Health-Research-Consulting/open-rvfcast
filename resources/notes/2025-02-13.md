## Data acquisition

- [ ] It seems like

## Cross-validation and model fitting

1.  Now that we have a draft approach for the tidymodels workflow
    ([106](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/open-rvfcast/issues/106);
    [spatiotemporal_cv.R](scripts/spatiotemporal_cv.R)), implement it in
    targets on actual data.
2.  

## Issue backlog

I think my major problem with issues is that they have been too large in
the past. Change to more atomic issues so they can be checked off in an
afternoon. This should help both keep the project moving and give me a
sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. Working on large,
nebulous issues is demoralizing.

1.  Started a new issue and branch,
    [\#107](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/open-rvfcast/issues/107),
    to come up with quarto document for evaluating model performance and
    some light EDA.
2.  Created a quarto [report](reports/model_performance_report.qmd) that
    gets generated every time the modeling pipeline is run. The report
    should be named based on the date and include the code commit hash
    in the header.
