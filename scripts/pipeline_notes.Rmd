## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r mermaid}
mer <- targets::tar_mermaid(targets_only = TRUE, outdated = FALSE,
                   legend = FALSE, color = FALSE,
                   script = h("_targets.R"))
cat(
  "```mermaid",
  mer[1],
  #'Objects([""Objects""]) --- Functions>""Functions""]',
  'subgraph Project Workflow',
  mer[3:length(mer)],
  'linkStyle 0 stroke-width:0px;',
  "```",
  sep = "\n")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
