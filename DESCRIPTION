Description: This pipeline gathers diverse and processes environmental and health 
data across Africa including weather, vegetation, terrain, soil, livestock, and 
disease outbreak records. It processes this raw data by calculating historical 
patterns and standardizing resolutions, then combines everything into a unified, 
time-partitioned dataset which can be used for epdiemiological modeling. The 
resulting data is used to forecast Rift Valley Fever outbreak risk in South Africa.
